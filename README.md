# sketchpad
Version 0.1 
- basic version

Version 0.2
- added Gradient and Trail options

Version 0.3
- added default 16x16 grid that shows up immediately upon loading the page
- moved menu from the top to the left side
- menu is now shown upon pressing the Show Settings button and disappears once entering the grid
- grid total height is now equal to its width (920px/920px). Height was 820px previously; moving menu to the left freed up some space.
